     the fastest computer in the world that can process
     a significant amount of data very quickly.
      The computing Performance of a “supercomputer”
     is measured very high as compared to a general
     purpose computer. The computing Performance of a
     supercomputer is measured in FLOPS (that is 
     floating-point operations per second) instead 
     of MIPS. The supercomputer consists of tens of 
     thousands of processors which can perform billions
     and trillions of calculations per second, or you
     can say that supercomputers can deliver up to nearly
     a hundred quadrillions.
     
     WORLDS SUPER FAST COMPUTER
     Frontier
        The Frontier supercomputer at the Department of
        Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory earned 
        the top ranking today as the world’s fastest on 
        the 59th TOP500 list, with 1.1 exaflops of performance.
        The system is the first to achieve an unprecedented
        level of computing performance known as exascale, 
        a threshold of a quintillion calculations per second.
        Frontier features a theoretical peak performance of
        2 exaflops, or two quintillion calculations per second,
        making it ten times more powerful than ORNL’s Summit 
        system. The system leverages ORNL’s extensive expertise 
        in accelerated computing and will enable scientists to
        develop critically needed technologies for the country’s
        energy, economic and national security, helping researchers
        address problems of national importance that were impossible
        to solve just five years ago.

        INDIA'S SUPER FAST COMPUTER
        AIRAWAT
        Supercomputing in India has a history going back to the 1980s.
        The Government of India created an indigenous development
        programme as they had difficulty purchasing foreign supercomputers.
        As of June 2023, the AIRAWAT supercomputer is the fastest supercomputer 
        in India, having been ranked 75th fastest in the world in the TOP500 supercomputer
        list. AIRAWAT has been installed at the Centre for Development of Advanced
        Computing (C-DAC) in Pune."/>
